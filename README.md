# IT45-Project

To compile the project, follow these steps:

1. Add execution permissions to the bash script:
	chmod 777 run.sh

2. If there is an error when executing the ./run.sh command:

	- Copy the content of the file.
	- Delete the file.
	- Create a new file named run.sh and paste the content into it.
The error occurs because run.sh was created on Windows, and there might be an issue during conversion to Linux.

3. ./run.sh should now work. Simply modify the instance name to test in the config.py file to test different problem instances.
